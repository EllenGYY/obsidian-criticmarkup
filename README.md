# Note about Wikilinks Suggestion Fix

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This fork attempts to fix Obsidian’s wikilink suggestion popup not appearing for the commentator plugin. The popup should now open when typing or pasting `[[`.
>
> - **Keep “Automatic tag completion” ENABLED** in settings. If you disable it, the cursor may jump around unexpectedly when typing CriticMarkup tags like `{++`.
> - **Suggestion Mode notice**: While wikilink suggestions popup do appear in Suggestion mode, it’s recommended to type the target file name out manually instead of accepting via Tab. Using Tab can be treated as a “change”, which may cause the link to become `~>[[Original Filename` and redirect incorrectly. Type the name fully to avoid this.


# CriticMarkup plugin for Obsidian

A [CriticMarkup](https://github.com/CriticMarkup/CriticMarkup-toolkit) renderer for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) for
collaborative editing and reviewing your notes. Includes a suggestion mode for keeping track of changes, and a comment mode for easily leaving comments.

This plugin was built upon the excellent work and advice of @kometenstaub, the original repositories can be found here: [CriticMarkup plugin](https://github.com/kometenstaub/obsidian-criticmarkup)
and [CriticMarkup parser](https://github.com/kometenstaub/lang-criticmarkup).

Roadmap for full product can be found below. No timeline will be given for when (and in which order)
these features will be implemented. If features prove to be completely infeasible to implement, they will be removed from the roadmap.

The plugin _is_ available for beta testing, but please keep in mind that you should not use this plugin in
your main vault. There is a non-zero risk of text being removed when using e.g. the suggestion mode.

Please report any errors or bug you encounter, especially when these result in loss of data or cause
crashes/malfuctions in Obsidian. In the [Obsidian Discord](https://discord.com/invite/obsidianmd), there is a thread
under `Extensions > Plugin Advanced > Commentator`, you can report bugs there, or in the [Github issues page](https://github.com/Fevol/obsidian-criticmarkup/issues).
